<h1>Increase Australia Unfair</h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Australians all let us bankrupt, for we pay fines and fees. With painted soil and no wealth to toil, our land is misery. Our land destroys all happiness and nothing here is free. You have to pay for your healthcare, increase Australia unfair, in ungrateful strains let us complain, increase Australia unfair.

Beneath all of our money loss, there's more problems than that, Australia is pure pollution and that is very bad. For those who come as refugees, this place is worse you see. No courage can help us at all, increase Australia unfair, in mournful strains let us complain, increase Australia unfair.

As we are ruining our country, that makes everyone sad. And since there is no colour green, that makes some people mad. With homelessness and loneliness across our whole country, we have no air but we don't care, increase Australia unfair, in hateful strains let us complain, increase Australia unfair.

Because we are Australian, we are in lots of pain. And with the ever-rising cost, there's no financial gain. We're all in debt and we regret coming to this country, we own no land and we eat sand, increase Australia unfair, in painful strains let us complain, increase Australia unfair.

Despite our lack of common sense, there are still rich that thrive. But for the abundance of us, we just have to abide. We'd even pay to get away but we're bankrupt you see. We've no such luck so we are stuck, increase Australia unfair, in lifeless strains let us complain, increase Australia unfair.</p>
